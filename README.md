# reddit-collapse-by-default

All Reddit comments collapsed by default (not just top level ones), and collapsing only hides children and doesn't hide the text of the post itself.

I am trying to test a hunch that I've had for some time that it would be better to read sibling comments first before deciding to go deeper onto any child comments.

Potential TODOs

- [ ] Integrate with RES auto-remember feature
- [ ] Show votes
- [ ] better UX through improved design

Questions, comments, issues and pull requests are welcome!
